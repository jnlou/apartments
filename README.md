# apartments
A text-based interface program where a user can see information about an apartment unit and decide if they would like to stay in.
It first filters each apartment according to the user's preferences (similar to apartmentlist.com),
Then at random, displays a unit and its description including price, square feet, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
It asks if the user is interested or not.
